## Installation

See [INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)

## Configuration & Theming

The config file can be found at *$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mirage/settings.json*, 
or *~/.config/mirage/settings.json*.

For Flatpak users, this will be
*~/.var/app/io.github.mirukana.mirage/config/mirage* instead.

The config folder where *accounts.json* and  *settings.json* is located can be
overriden by setting the `MIRAGE_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.  

The user data folder where *themes*, encryption data and interface states
are saved can be overriden with `MIRAGE_DATA_DIR`.

The cache folder where downloaded files and thumbnails are saved can be
overriden with `MIRAGE_CACHE_DIR`.

The `theme` setting can be:

- The filename of a built-in theme (`Midnight.qpl` or `Glass.qpl`)
- The filename of a custom theme at 
  *$XDG_DATA_HOME/mirage/themes*, *~/.local/share/mirage/themes*,
  or *~/.var/app/io.github.mirukana.mirage/data/mirage/themes* (Flatpak)

A default theme from this repository can be copied to use as a base and edit,
for example:

```sh
    cp mirage/src/themes/Midnight.qpl \
       "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}/mirage/themes/MyTheme.qpl"
```

Or for Flatpak users:

```sh
    cp mirage/src/themes/Midnight.qpl \
       ~/.var/app/io.github.mirukana.mirage/data/mirage/themes/MyTheme.qpl
```

The config setting `theme` would need to be set to `MyTheme.qpl` in this case.

Theme files are nested-by-indentations sections of properties and values.  
Properties are declared as `<type> <name>: <value>`.  
Values can be any JavaScript (ECMAScript 7) expressions.

Most of the properties are of type `color`.
Their values, if not just refering to another property,
can be expressed with a:
- [SVG/CSS color name](https://www.december.com/html/spec/colorsvg.html)
  string, e.g. `"blue"`
- Hexadecimal code string, e.g. `"#fff"` or `"#cc0000"`
- RGBA value, using the `Qt.rgba(0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 0-1)` function
- HSLA value, using the `Qt.hsla(0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 0-1)` function
- HSVA value, using the `Qt.hsva(0-1, 0-1, 0-1, 0-1)` function
- [HSLUV](https://www.hsluv.org/) value, using the
  `hsluv(0-360, 0-100, 0-100, 0-1)` function. This is the prefered method 
  used throughout the default theme files
  (why? see [this](https://www.hsluv.org/comparison/#rainbow-hsluv) and
  [that](https://www.boronine.com/2012/03/26/Color-Spaces-for-Human-Beings/#hsl-is-a-lemon))

If you just want to change the background picture,
or use a gradient/simple color instead, search for the `ui:` section in your
text editor.


With `Alt+Shift+R` by default, the config and theme can be reloaded without 
restarting the app.

**Warnings**: 

- API currently unstable: theme properties are often renamed, added or deleted.
- The file format for both config and themes will soon change
- The current file format forces all theme to have all properties
  defined, instead of being able to only specify the ones to override from the
  default theme.

GUI settings will also be implemented in the future.
